# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and learning from mistakes.
- Prioritizing the health of the community over individual preference.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that is reasonably inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate corrective action in response to behavior
that is inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions (issues, comments, pull
requests, commits, and other interactions) that are not aligned with this Code
of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all cofy-x community spaces and when an
individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Report sensitive incidents using private channels in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
For non-sensitive conduct concerns, use the maintainers' public communication
channels listed in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

All reports will be reviewed promptly and fairly. Maintainers will respect the
privacy and security of reporters.
